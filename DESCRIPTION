Description: An automated pipe for reproducible RNA-seq analysis with the minimal efforts from researchers. The package can process bulk RNA-seq data and single-cell RNA-seq data. You can only provide the taxa name and the accession id of RNA-seq data deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). After a cup of tea or longer, you will get formated gene expression data as gene count and transcript count based on both alignment-based and alignment-free workflows.
