Description: An automated pipe for reproducible RNA-seq analysis with the minimal efforts from researchers. You only need to provide the taxa name and the accession code of RNA-seq samples deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). After a cup of tea or longer, you will get formated gene expression data as gene count, transcript count and TPM values, etc.
