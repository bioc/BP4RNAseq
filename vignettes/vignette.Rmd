# Introduction

Processing raw reads of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data, no matter public or newly sequenced data, involves a lot of specialized tools and technical configurations that are often unfamiliar and time-consuming to learn for non-bioinformatics researchers. The goal of BP4RNAseq is to make the RNA-seq analysis smooth and easy. The package integrates the state-of-art tools from both alignment-based and alignment-free quantification workflows. It uses an optimized pipeline, applies to both retrospective and newly generated RNA-seq data analyses and can take only two nontechnical parameters and output two formatted gene expression quantification at gene and transcript levels. The package focuses on bulk RNA-seq analysis. However, it is also applicable for single-cell RNA-seq data using the Alevin algorithm [@Srivastava2019].

# Dependencies 

BP4RNAseq runs in Windows (Subsystem for Linux), Linux and macOS. It requires the following utilities:

* [SRA Toolkit >= 2.10.3](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?view=toolkit_doc)
* [Entrez Direct >= 13.3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179288/)
* [FastQC >= v0.11.9](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)
* [Cutadapt >= 2.10](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* [SAMtools >= 1.9](http://www.htslib.org/)
* [HISAT2 >= 2.2.0](http://daehwankimlab.github.io/hisat2/)
* [StringTie >= 2.1.1](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie/)
* [Salmon >= 1.2.1](https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon/)  
* [jq >= 1.6](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
* [R >= 3.5.0](https://www.r-project.org/)

Users can install these dependencies manually.  

Alternatively, we provide a bash script to aid users to install all the dependencies based on [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/). The script uses Wget, which is pre-installed on most Linux distributions such as Windows Subsystem for Linux, to download conda. If wget is not installed, users can easily install it with the following commands. 

* Installing Wget on Ubuntu and Debian or Windows Subsystem equivalents
```r
sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get install -y wget
```
* Installing Wget on CentOS and Fedora or Windows Subsystem equivalents
```r
sudo yum install wget
```
* Installing Wget on macOS with Homebrew
```r
brew install wget
```

With Wget installed, users can install all the dependencies with the following commands:
``` r
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sunshanwen/BP4RNAseq/master/install_depends.sh
chmod +x install_depends.sh
./install_depends.sh
./use_conda.sh
```

# Usage

## Bulk RNA-seq analyses
The functions in BP4RNAseq are integrated into two main functions: down2quan for public RNA-seq data, fastq2quan for newly generated RNA-seq data. 

down2quan requires no input data and can receive only two nontechnical parameters. The parameter 'accession' specifies the accession id of the target public RNA-seq data in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) or the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). The accession id can be of a whole 'BioProject' or multiple 'BioSample'. The parameter 'taxa' offers the scientific or common name of the organism investigated. A simple example 
``` r
library(BP4RNAseq)
down2quan(accession=c("SRR11486115","SRR11486114"), taxa="Drosophila melanogaster")
```
will download the public RNA-seq data from two 'BioSample' with accession id "SRR11486115" and "SRR11486114", respectively, and the latest reference genome, transcript and annotation data of Drosophila melanogaster, do the quality control (filter out the poor-quality reads and contaminations), reads alignments and gene expression quantification based on both alignment-free and alignment-based workflows in the work directory. During the quality control procedure, if the contamination of the adapter exists, the program will automatically detect the adapter sequence to trim. However, an option is given to the users to provide the adapter sequence if they know it. 

fastq2quan works with local RNA-seq data in fastq formats. It needs two nontechnical parameters at a minimum, i.e., 'taxa' as explained above and 'pair' which specifies the sequencing type with 'single' for single-end (SE) reads or 'paired' for paired-end (PE) reads. Users should place all the fastq files in the work directory. A simple example 
``` r
library(BP4RNAseq)
fastq2quan(taxa="Drosophila melanogaster", pair = "single")
```
will download the latest reference genome, transcript and annotation data of Drosophila melanogaster, and do the quality control, reads alignments and gene expression quantification using the local RNA-seq data based on both alignment-free and alignment-based workflows as the program down2quan do. 

Both programs support the parallel computing, which is specified by the 'threads' parameter. 

### Outputs

The outputs of both functions are two gene count matrixes and two transcript count matrixes based on alignment-based workflow and alignment-free workflow. Researchers can use the averages over two workflows for downstream analyses [@Lachmann2020] or decide the type of data to use retrospectively based on the results from the downstream analyses.

## Single-cell RNA-seq analyses

down2quan and fastq2quan can also be extended to process single-cell RNA-seq data by setting the 'scRNA' parameter to be 'TRUE' and specifying the protocols. Currently, dropseq, chromium and chromiumV3 are supported protocols. A simple example 
``` r
library(BP4RNAseq)
down2quan(accession=c("SRR11402955","SRR11402974"), taxa="Homo sapiens", scRNA = TRUE, protocol = "dropseq")
```
will download the public single-cell RNA-seq data from two 'BioSample' with accession id "SRR11402955" and "SRR11402974", respectively, and the latest reference genome, transcript and annotation data of Homo sapiens, do the quality control, reads alignments and gene expression quantification based on the Alevin workflow.

Alternatively,
``` r
library(BP4RNAseq)
fastq2quan(taxa="Homo sapiens", scRNA = TRUE, protocol = "dropseq")
```
can preprocess local single-cell RNA-seq data in fastq formats. The data are paired-end reads with one read containing cellular barcode and unique molecule identifier (UMI) and the other read being the RNA sequence.

### Outputs 

The outputs of down2quan and fastq2quan are gene count matrix compressed in binary format, and gene ids, barcode + UMI and tier categorization in three separate files. These outputs can be further processed with [tximport](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/tximport/inst/doc/tximport.html) and [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/).
